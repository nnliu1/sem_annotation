# Ontology Term Recommendation System for Energy data Publication
This repository contains the base code for an ontology term recommendation system, which will be integrated into the Energy Data Orchestrator (EDO) platform,  and its user interface will be deployed online alongside EDO.

The goal of this system is to assist users in semantically annotating their datasets. When a user provides column descriptions through EDO‚Äôs interface, this system will:

- Automatically suggest the top-k most relevant ontology terms from a preselected ontology

- Support semantic interoperability and ensure that your data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

## Install dependencies
#### Setup with Conda
This project uses a Conda environment defined in `environment.yml`  

**Step 1: Create the environment**
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

#### 1. Run recommendation system

```
py src/main.py
```
