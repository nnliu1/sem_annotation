It is made from calcium carbonate (limestone) and carbon-containing reductant (petroleum coke).",

The processes and applications for which these various HFCs are being used include insulation boards and panels, pipe sections, sprayed systems and onecomponent gap filling foams. For open-cell foams, such as integral skin products for automotive steering wheels and facias, emissions of HFCs used as blowing agents are likely to occur during the manufacturing process. In closedcell foam, emissions not only occur during the manufacturing phase, but usually extend into the in-use phase and often the majority of emission occurs at the endof-life (de-commissioning losses).
